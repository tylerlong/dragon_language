Dragon Language is the hundred-year language, inspired by http://www.paulgraham.com/hundred.html.



Methodology
***********
Dragon Language must not be "yet another programming language". The world doesn't need that. 
Focus on the language core. How to implement the language is another thing and it is not important. 
    With a well designed language core, some talented people will help you to implement it.
    the language core could be implemented in C, C++, C#, Java, Python, Ruby...etc and it just doesn't matter because computers are bocoming faster and faster.
    So forget the implementation when designing.
Avoid to be an evolutionary dead-end. Stay close to the main branches of the evolutionary trees.
Maintain a minimum set of fundamental operators, the fewer, the better.
Separate the meaning of a program from the implementation details.
